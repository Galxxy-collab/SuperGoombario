# SuperGoombario
In this repository is the pixel art and code that a team and I created in high school as a spin off game based off the Mario Bros series.
In the game, you play as the main character goombario in which you have to stomp on enimies in order to reach the end of the level.
You can find the pixel art for all animations of the main character, enemies, pipes, spikes, and more.

The code for this project is incomplete with some minor glitches and the game was coded using pygame which includes similar features to the Super Mario Bros series.

*Disclaimer* All art in this project is original and designed by myself.
