# GoombarioPixelArt
In this repository is the pixel art I created in high school for a spin off Mario Bros series game called "Super Goombario".
You can find items such as all animations for the main character, enemies, pipes, spikes, and more.

The code for this project is incomplete with some minor glitches. The game was coded using pygame and includes similar features to the Super Mario Bros series.

*Disclaimer* All art in this project is original and designed by me.
